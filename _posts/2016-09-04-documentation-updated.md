title: Significant documentation updates
---

This weekend has resulted in a lot of improvements to the documentation section!
Hopefully it's a lot more informative, and has a better structure for those not
yet familiar with FIRSTwiki. It's come a long way since April, [check it out](/docs/)!

If you have suggestions, file an issue on github or send us a pull request!
