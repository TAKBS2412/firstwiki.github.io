Because [FIRSTwiki is not a traditional wiki](/docs/design/), it isn't easy
to allow completely unmoderated content. Instead, there is a team of moderators
that will approve contributions.

Who can be a moderator?
=======================

FIRSTwiki is still developing, but initially there will be some qualifications
for moderators. Here are some initial minimum qualifications.

* Must be involved with FIRST Robotics Programs for at least a year
* Should be a validated [ChiefDelphi](https://www.chiefdelphi.com) member who
  has positive reputation and 300+ posts

As the community grows, these conditions will probably change.

Role of moderators
==================

Moderators are intended to serve the following roles:

* Gatekeepers for FIRSTwiki to ensure that it only receives high quality content
* Be neutral intermediaries in the event of a conflict
* TODO

A moderator is expected to speedily approve content if it is topical and meets
the FIRStwiki standards.
