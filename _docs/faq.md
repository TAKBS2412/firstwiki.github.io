### Why aren't you using wiki software like Wikipedia does?

The previous incarnation of FIRSTwiki in fact did use MediaWiki, the software
that runs wikipedia. However, that requires having a server, and also means that
someone has to maintain the server, and policing needs to be done to prevent the
site from being overrun with spam. That's fairly complicated and involves a lot
of effort.

On the other hand, Github pages provides free hosting, takes care of server 
maintenance, and does a really good job of preventing spammers from using their
service. It's a little more involved, but I think the tradeoffs make it worth
it.

### What should I post on FIRSTwiki?

Glad you asked! See [this section](/docs/content/) for details.
