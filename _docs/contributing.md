FIRSTwiki is an open project that all members of the FIRST community can easily
and quickly contribute to. We believe that by providing open content we can
better serve the FIRST community.

How to contribute
-----------------

FIRSTwiki is not a traditional wiki, instead it's a bunch of
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatted files stored
in a git repository that are rendered and served via [github
pages](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) (via
[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)).

Because of these differences, we provide two guides for contributors:

* [Non-technical user guide](editing)
* [Technical user guide](editing-advanced)
